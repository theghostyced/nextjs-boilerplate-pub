This project is built using Next.js 14 and Contentful.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Node.js - 16 or higher
- Yarn or npm
- Contentful env - Get this from the 1password

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `yarn install`
3. Get your Contentful space and get the space ID and access token
4. Create a `.env.local` file and add your Contentful space ID and access token
5. Run the development server using `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

## Typescript and Contenful

`/src/types/contentful.d.ts` is generated by the `contentful-typescript-codegen`. This contains `interfaces` for each content model in Contentful. It is run during `npm run dev` and use `getContentfulEnvironment` to access Contentful.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into tomfoolery with your code editor not recognizing Next type declarations, check out this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69238794/cannot-find-module-next-or-its-corresponding-type-declarations). Sometimes newer versions of `yarn` need a little coaxing to behave.
